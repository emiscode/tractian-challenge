### Improvements to be done

- Unit and Integration Tests: Add comprehensive unit and integration tests using a testing library like Jest and React Testing Library to ensure the reliability and stability of the components.

- Detailed Asset View: Enhance the asset detail view to display more information, such as historical data, graphs for sensor readings, and status over time.

- Improve error handling to provide users with meaningful error messages and feedback when API calls fail or when there are issues with data fetching or processing.

- Improve state management, and integrate the logic within the zustand store, instead of using prop params and useEffects.
